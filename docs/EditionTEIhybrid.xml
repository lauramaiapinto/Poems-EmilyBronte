        <l>Ah! why, because the <seg ana="nature">dazzling sun</seg></l>
        <l>Restored my earth to <seg ana="love">joy</seg></l>
        <l>Have you departed, every one,</l>
        <l>And left a <seg ana="sadness">desert sky</seg>?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>All through the <seg ana="nature">night</seg>, your glorious eyes</l>
        <l>Were gazing down in mine,</l>
        <l>And with a full heart's thankful <seg ana="love">sighs</seg></l>
        <l>I blessed that watch divine!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>I was at peace, and drank your <seg ana="nature">beams</seg></l>
        <l>As they were life to me</l>
        <l>And revelled in my <seg ana="love">changeful dreams</seg></l>
        <l>Like <seg ana="nature">petrel</seg> on the <seg ana="nature">sea</seg>.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>Why did the morning rise to break</l>
        <l>So great, so pure a spell,</l>
        <l>And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek</l>
        <l>Where your cool radiance fell?</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>Blood-red he rose, and arrow-straight,</l>
        <l>His fierce beams struck my brow;</l>
        <l>The soul of Nature sprang elate,</l>
        <l>But mine sank sad and low!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>My lids closed down—yet through their veil</l>
        <l>I saw him blazing still;</l>
        <l>And bathe in gold the misty dale,</l>
        <l>And flash upon the hill.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>I turned me to the pillow then</l>
        <l>To call back <seg ana="time">Night</seg>, and see</l>
        <l>Your worlds of solemn light, again</l>
        <l>Throb with my heart and me!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>It would not do—the pillow glowed</l>
        <l>And glowed both roof and floor,</l>
        <l>And birds sang loudly in the wood,</l>
        <l>And fresh winds shook the door.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>The curtains waved, the wakened flies</l>
        <l>Were murmuring round my room,</l>
        <l>Imprisoned there, till I should rise</l>
        <l>And give them leave to roam.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>O <seg ana="love">Stars</seg> and <seg ana="love">Dreams</seg> and Gentle <seg ana="time">Night</seg>;</l>
        <l>O <seg ana="time">Night</seg> and <seg ana="love">Stars</seg> return!</l>
        <l>And hide me from the hostile light</l>
        <l>That does not warm, but burn—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>That drains the blood of suffering men;</l>
        <l>Drinks tears, instead of dew:</l>
        <l>Let me sleep through his blinding reign,</l>
        <l>And only wake with you!</l>

        <l>Cold in the <seg ana="nature">earth</seg>—and the deep <seg ana="time">snow</seg> piled above thee,</l>
        <l>Far, far removed, cold in the <seg ana="sadness">dreary grave</seg>!</l>
        <l>Have I forgot, my only <seg ana="love">Love</seg>, to love thee,</l>

        <l>Cold in the <seg ana="nature">earth</seg>—and fifteen wild <seg ana="time">Decembers</seg>,</l>

      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>Sweet <seg ana="love">Love</seg> of youth, forgive, if I forget thee,</l>
        <l>While the world's <seg ana="time">tide</seg> is bearing me along;</l>
        <l>Other desires and other hopes beset me,</l>
        <l>Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee <seg ana="sadness">wrong</seg>!</l>
      </lg>

        <l>No later <seg ana="time">light</seg> has lightened up my <seg ana="nature">heaven</seg>,</l>
        <l>No second <seg ana="time">morn</seg> has ever shone for me;</l>
        <l>All my life's <seg ana="love">bliss</seg> from thy dear life was given,</l>

        <l>And even <seg ana="sadness">Despair</seg> was powerless to destroy,</l>
        <l>Then did I learn how <seg ana="love">existence</seg> could be cherished,</l>
        <l>Strengthened, and fed without the aid of <seg ana="love">joy</seg>.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>Then did I check the <seg ana="sadness">tears</seg> of useless <seg ana="love">passion</seg>—</l>
        <l>Weaned my young <seg ana="love">soul</seg> from yearning after thine;</l>
        <l>Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten</l>

        <l>I'll not weep, because the <seg ana="time">summer's glory</seg></l>
        <l>Must always end in <seg ana="sadness">gloom</seg>;</l>
        <l>And, follow out the happiest story—</l>
        <l>It closes with a <seg ana="sadness">tomb</seg>!</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>And I am weary of the <seg ana="sadness">anguish</seg></l>
        <l>Increasing <seg ana="time">winters</seg> bear;</l>
        <l>Weary to watch the <seg ana="love">spirit</seg> languish</l>
        <l>Through years of dead <seg ana="sadness">despair</seg>.</l>

      <head>Plead For Me</head>
      <lg>
        <l>OH, thy bright <seg ana="love">eyes</seg> must answer now,</l>
        <l>When <seg ana="love">Reason</seg>, with a scornful brow,</l>
        <l>Is mocking at my <seg ana="sadness">overthrow</seg> !</l>
        <l>Oh, thy sweet <seg ana="love">tongue</seg> must plead for me</l>
        <l>And tell why I have chosen thee !</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>Stern <seg ana="love">Reason</seg> is to judgment come,</l>
        <l>Arrayed in all her forms of <seg ana="sadness">gloom</seg> :</l>
        <l>Wilt thou, my <seg ana="love">advocate</seg>, be dumb ?</l>
        <l>No, radiant <seg ana="love">angel</seg>, speak and say</l>
        <l>Why I did cast the world away,—</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>Why I have persevered to shun</l>
        <l>The common paths that others run ;</l>
        <l>And on a strange road journeyed on,</l>
        <l>Heedless, alike of <seg ana="love">wealth</seg> and <seg ana="love">power</seg> —</l>
        <l>Of glory's wreath and <seg ana="love">pleasure's flower</seg>.</l>
      </lg>
      <lg>
        <l>These, once, indeed, seemed <seg ana="love">Beings Divine</seg> ;</l>
        <l>And they, perchance, heard <seg ana="love">vows</seg> of mine,</l>
        <l>And saw my <seg ana="love">offerings</seg> on their <seg ana="love">shrine</seg> ;</l>
        <l>But careless gifts are seldom prized,</l>
        <l>And mine were worthily despised.</l>
