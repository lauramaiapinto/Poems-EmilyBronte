              <l>The night is darkening round me,</l>
              <l>The wild winds coldly blow;</l>
              <l>But a tyrant spell has bound me</l>
              <l>And I cannot, cannot go.</l>

            <lg>
              <l>The giant trees are bending</l>
              <l>Their bare boughs weighed with snow;</l>
              <l>And the storm is fast descending,</l>
              <l>And yet I cannot go.</l>
            </lg>

            <lg>
              <l>Clouds beyond clouds above me,</l>
              <l>Wastes beyond wastes below;</l>
              <l>But nothing drear can move me:</l>
              <l>I will not, cannot go.</l>

      <head>Ah! Why, Because the Dazzling Sun</head>

      <lg>
        <l>Ah! why, because the dazzling sun</l>
        <l>Restored my earth to joy</l>
        <l>Have you departed, every one,</l>
        <l>And left a desert sky?</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>All through the night, your glorious eyes</l>
        <l>Were gazing down in mine,</l>
        <l>And with a full heart's thankful sighs</l>
        <l>I blessed that watch divine!</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>I was at peace, and drank your beams</l>
        <l>As they were life to me</l>
        <l>And revelled in my changeful dreams</l>
        <l>Like petrel on the sea.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Thought followed thought—star followed star</l>
        <l>Through boundless regions on,</l>
        <l>While one sweet influence, near and far,</l>
        <l>Thrilled through and proved us one.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Why did the morning rise to break</l>
        <l>So great, so pure a spell,</l>
        <l>And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek</l>
        <l>Where your cool radiance fell?</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Blood-red he rose, and arrow-straight,</l>
        <l>His fierce beams struck my brow;</l>
        <l>The soul of Nature sprang elate,</l>
        <l>But mine sank sad and low!</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>My lids closed down—yet through their veil</l>
        <l>I saw him blazing still;</l>
        <l>And bathe in gold the misty dale,</l>
        <l>And flash upon the hill.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>I turned me to the pillow then</l>
        <l>To call back Night, and see</l>
        <l>Your worlds of solemn light, again</l>
        <l>Throb with my heart and me!</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>It would not do—the pillow glowed</l>
        <l>And glowed both roof and floor,</l>
        <l>And birds sang loudly in the wood,</l>
        <l>And fresh winds shook the door.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>The curtains waved, the wakened flies</l>
        <l>Were murmuring round my room,</l>
        <l>Imprisoned there, till I should rise</l>
        <l>And give them leave to roam.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>O Stars and Dreams and Gentle Night;</l>
        <l>O Night and Stars return!</l>
        <l>And hide me from the hostile light</l>
        <l>That does not warm, but burn—</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>That drains the blood of suffering men;</l>
        <l>Drinks tears, instead of dew:</l>
        <l>Let me sleep through his blinding reign,</l>
        <l>And only wake with you!</l>

      <head>Love and Friendship</head>

      <lg>
        <l>Love is like the wild rose-briar,</l>
        <l>Friendship like the holly-tree—</l>
        <l>The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms</l>
        <l>But which will bloom most constantly?</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring,</l>
        <l>Its summer blossoms scent the air;</l>
        <l>Yet wait till winter comes again</l>
        <l>And who will call the wild-briar fair?</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now</l>
        <l>And deck thee with the holly’s sheen,</l>
        <l>That when December blights thy brow</l>
        <l>He still may leave thy garland green.</l>

        <l>No coward soul is mine</l>
        <l>No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere</l>
        <l>I see Heaven's glories shine</l>

        <l>Vain are the thousand creeds</l>
        <l>That move men's hearts, unutterably vain,</l>

        <l>Or idlest froth amid the boundless main</l>

        <l>To waken doubt in one</l>

      <lg>
        <l>With wide-embracing love</l>
        <l>Thy spirit animates eternal years</l>
        <l>Pervades and broods above,</l>
        <l>Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates and rears</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Though earth and moon were gone</l>
        <l>And suns and universes ceased to be</l>
        <l>And Thou wert left alone</l>
        <l>Every Existence would exist in thee</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>There is not room for Death</l>
        <l>Nor atom that his might could render void</l>

      <lg>
        <l>Long neglect has worn away</l>
        <l>Half the sweet enchanting smile;</l>
        <l>Time has turned the bloom to gray;</l>
        <l>Mold and damp the face defile.</l>

        <l>But that lock of silky hair,</l>

        <l>Paints their image on the mind.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Fair the hand that traced that line,</l>
        <l>“Dearest, ever deem me true”;</l>
        <l>Swiftly flew the fingers fine</l>
        <l>When the pen that motto drew.</l>

      <head>Remembrance</head>

      <lg>
        <l>Cold in the earth—and the deep snow piled above thee,</l>
        <l>Far, far removed, cold in the dreary grave!</l>
        <l>Have I forgot, my only Love, to love thee,</l>
        <l>Severed at last by Time's all-severing wave?</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Now, when alone, do my thoughts no longer hover</l>
        <l>Over the mountains, on that northern shore,</l>
        <l>Resting their wings where heath and fern-leaves cover</l>
        <l>Thy noble heart forever, ever more?</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Cold in the earth—and fifteen wild Decembers,</l>
        <l>From those brown hills, have melted into spring:</l>
        <l>Faithful, indeed, is the spirit that remembers</l>
        <l>After such years of change and suffering!</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Sweet Love of youth, forgive, if I forget thee,</l>
        <l>While the world's tide is bearing me along;</l>
        <l>Other desires and other hopes beset me,</l>
        <l>Hopes which obscure, but cannot do thee wrong!</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>No later light has lightened up my heaven,</l>
        <l>No second morn has ever shone for me;</l>
        <l>All my life's bliss from thy dear life was given,</l>
        <l>All my life's bliss is in the grave with thee.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>But, when the days of golden dreams had perished,</l>
        <l>And even Despair was powerless to destroy,</l>
        <l>Then did I learn how existence could be cherished,</l>
        <l>Strengthened, and fed without the aid of joy.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Then did I check the tears of useless passion—</l>
        <l>Weaned my young soul from yearning after thine;</l>
        <l>Sternly denied its burning wish to hasten</l>
        <l>Down to that tomb already more than mine.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>And, even yet, I dare not let it languish,</l>
        <l>Dare not indulge in memory's rapturous pain;</l>
        <l>Once drinking deep of that divinest anguish,</l>
        <l>How could I seek the empty world again?</l>

      <head>I Am the Only Being Whose Doom</head>

      <lg>
        <l>I am the only being whose doom</l>
        <l>No tongue would ask, no eye would mourn;</l>
        <l>I never caused a thought of gloom,</l>
        <l>A smile of joy, since I was born.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>In secret pleasure, secret tears,</l>
        <l>This changeful life has slipped away,</l>
        <l>As friendless after eighteen years,</l>
        <l>As lone as on my natal day.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>There have been times I cannot hide,</l>
        <l>There have been times when this was drear,</l>
        <l>When my sad soul forgot its pride</l>
        <l>And longed for one to love me here.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>But those were in the early glow</l>
        <l>Of feelings since subdued by care;</l>
        <l>And they have died so long ago,</l>
        <l>I hardly now believe they were.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>First melted off the hope of youth,</l>
        <l>Then fancy’s rainbow fast withdrew;</l>
        <l>And then experience told me truth</l>
        <l>In mortal bosoms never grew.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>’Twas grief enough to think mankind</l>
        <l>All hollow, servile, insincere;</l>
        <l>But worse to trust to my own mind</l>
        <l>And find the same corruption there.</l>

        <l>Wilt thou, my advocate, be dumb ?</l>
        <l>No, radiant angel, speak and say</l>
        <l>Why I did cast the world away,—</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>Why I have persevered to shun</l>
        <l>The common paths that others run ;</l>
        <l>And on a strange road journeyed on,</l>
        <l>Heedless, alike of wealth and power —</l>
        <l>Of glory's wreath and pleasure's flower.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>These, once, indeed, seemed Beings Divine ;</l>
        <l>And they, perchance, heard vows of mine,</l>
        <l>And saw my offerings on their shrine ;</l>
        <l>But careless gifts are seldom prized,</l>
        <l>And mine were worthily despised.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>So, with a ready heart, I swore</l>
        <l>To seek their altar-stone no more ;</l>
        <l>And gave my spirit to adore</l>
        <l>Thee, ever-present, phantom thing—</l>
        <l>My slave, my comrade, and my king.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>A slave, because I rule thee still ;</l>
        <l>Incline thee to my changeful will,</l>
        <l>And make thy influence good or ill :</l>
        <l>A comrade, for by day and night</l>
        <l>Thou art my intimate delight,—</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>My darling pain that wounds and sears,</l>
        <l>And wrings a blessing out from tears</l>
        <l>By deadening me to earthly cares ;</l>
        <l>And yet, a king, though Prudence well</l>
        <l>Have taught thy subject to rebel.</l>
      </lg>

      <lg>
        <l>And am I wrong to worship where</l>
        <l>Faith cannot doubt, nor hope despair,</l>
        <l>Since my own soul can grant my prayer ?</l>
        <l>Speak, God of visions, plead for me,</l>
        <l>And tell why I have chosen thee !</l>
      </lg>
